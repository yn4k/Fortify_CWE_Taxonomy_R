							   Build Misconfiguration: External Ant Dependency Repository
							</h1>
							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  This ant build script relies on external sources, which could allow an attacker to insert malicious code into the final product or to take control of the build machine.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Several tools exist within the Java development world to aid in dependency management: both Apache Ant and Apache Maven build systems include functionality specifically designed to help manage dependencies and Apache Ivy is developed explicitly as a dependency manager. Although there are differences in their behavior, these tools share the common functionality that they automatically download external dependencies specified in the build process at build time. This makes it much easier for developer B to build software in the same manner as developer A. Developers just store dependency information in the build file, which means that each developer and build engineer has a consistent way to obtain dependencies, compile the code, and deploy without the dependency management hassles involved in manual dependency management. The following examples illustrate how Ivy, Ant and Maven can be used to manage external dependencies as part of a build process.<br><br>Developers specify external dependencies in an Ant target using a <code>&lt;get&gt;</code> task, which retrieves the dependency specified by the corresponding URL. This approach is functionally equivalent to scenario where a developer documents each external dependency as an artifact included with the software project, but is more desirable because it automates the retrieval and incorporation of the dependencies when a build is performed.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following excerpt from an Ant build.xml configuration file shows a typical reference to an external dependency:<br><br></p>
<pre><br>&lt;get src="http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/openejb/openejb-jee/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/openejb-jee-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"<br>dest="${maven.repo.local}/org/apache/openejb/openejb-jee/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/openejb-jee-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"<br>usetimestamp="true" ignoreerrors="true"/&gt;<br></pre>
<br><br>Two distinct types of attack scenarios affect these systems: An attacker could either compromise the server hosting the dependency or compromise the DNS server the build machine uses to redirect requests for hostname of the server hosting the dependency to a machine controlled by the attacker. Both scenarios result in the attacker gaining the ability to inject a malicious version of a dependency into a build running on an otherwise uncompromised machine.<br><br>Regardless of the attack vector used to deliver the Trojan dependency, these scenarios share the common element that the build system blindly accepts the malicious binary and includes it in the build. Because the build system has no recourse for rejecting the malicious binary and existing security mechanisms, such as code review, typically focus on internally-developed code rather than external dependencies, this type of attack has a strong potential to go unnoticed as it spreads through the development environment and potentially into production.<br><br>Although there is some risk of a compromised dependency being introduced into a manual build process, by the tendency of automated build systems to retrieve the dependency from an external source each time the build system is run in a new environment greatly increases the window of opportunity for an attacker. An attacker need only compromise the dependency server or the DNS server during one of the many times the dependency is retrieved in order to compromise the machine on which the build is occurring.
